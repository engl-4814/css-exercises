# CSS Sizing and Values

**To be completed in class in small groups together.**

Exercise your knowledge of CSS absolute and relative lengths.

In groups of 2 (3 if needed), work together to write a solution to prompts 2 and 3. However, each person will write their code, so they get the 'exercise'.

To set up your files, complete the following:

1. Copy and paste the `tocopy.html` file into the root of the `2-sizing-units` exercise folder.
2. Copy and paste the `tocopy.css` file into the `css` folder.
3. Rename each file with your last name.
4. Be sure to `link` your CSS file to your HTML file.
5. CODE!
