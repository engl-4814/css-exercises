  Below, for #1, create a new class or classes to test out padding and margins with any of the lengths' values.
  Be sure to test them out in the browser's inspection tool.

  Be sure to understand the difference between padding and margins and how to write the shorthand versions.

  2. IMAGE SIZING
================*/
/*
  Below, apply and inspect your work as you go, making sure they each work ...

  1.a viewport width of 65 (65vw) to the section with the class "img_sizing__container"
    - What does this select and do, and how does it impact the elements inside of it?

  2. an absolute length of 100 pixels (100px to the image with the "img_absolute_px" class

  3. a percentage relative length to the image with an "img_relative_percentage" class

  4. a viewport width relative length to the image with an "img_relative_vw" class

  REVIEW
    - Inspect each image and change their values.
    - AS you do so, also hover over the HTML of those images to compare their box dimensions and see if you understand why their size is as it is.
