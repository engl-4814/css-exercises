# @media Query Practice

1. Copy the `to-copy` folder. 
2. Rename it with your lastname.
3. Review the HTML and consider how to style the elements within the `section`.
4. Use `@media` queries to apply either flex or grid or both at **medium** and **large** screen-size *breakpoints*. `:-)` 
    * See [screensiz.es](screensiz.es) for breakpoints to use.
