# CSS Selection & Basic Rules Practice

**IMPORTANT** For this particular assignment, please do not push your code iteratively as usual. Please wait until just before class. That way, everyone has an opportunity to complete the assignment on their own.

## Setup Your Exercise Workflow

1. First, ***read the readings / watch the videos*** before attempting to complete this exercise.
2. Copy the `lindgren.html` file. Make sure it is within the root of this `1-selection` folder.
3. Rename this copied `.html` file with your last name.
4. Copy the `copyme.css` file in the `assets/css` folder. Make sure this copy is within the `assets/css` folder.
5. Rename this copied `.css` file with your last name.
6. Open your `html` and `css` files in the vertical pane view, so you can read both files throughout the assignment.

7. Click into your `index.html` file and then click "Go Live" to open your page in the browser (Firefox please!).
8. In Firefox, right-click on the page and select "Inspect Element" to open the inspection tool.
9. In your HTML document, link your `.css` stylesheet to this `.html` file with `<link>`.
    - **WARNING**: If you don't link the html and css files together, none of your CSS will be applied to the HTML. :-D
10. Follow the prompts in the `.html` and `.css` documents to complete the assignment.
    - **NOTE**: There is only one prompt in the `.html` file regarding the `<link>` to the CSS file.

## TIPS

- **Slow Down**: So many students skip the following steps and write a bunch of CSS before testing it in the browser before moving onto the next task. Don't create 5 errors across multiple parts of your page, then try to figure out what's wrong. Work iteratively instead.
    - Be sure to practice selecting one element at a time, adding a ruleset, and then testing it in your browser **before moving onto the next prompt**.
    - **USE YOUR BROWSER AND THE INSPECTION TOOL!** Make a change in your CSS, save it, then review it in your browser. If you don't practice this step-by-step process, you risk creating a twisty ALL-THE-ERRORS knot to untie.

## EXAMPLE END RESULT

Your end result should look something like the below image. Of course, your idiosyncratic choices with text/font and spacing choices will make it slightly different.
